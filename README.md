# Mileage-Prediction-Project
# Mileage Prediction using Regression Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the mileage (miles per gallon, MPG) of cars based on various features such as the number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. We employ a linear regression model for this predictive analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [YBI Foundation Dataset](https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/MPG.csv). It contains several features related to car specifications and their corresponding mileage.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualization and summary statistics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Building**: Training a linear regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and understanding the model's performance.

## How to Run the Project
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Mileage-Prediction-Project.git
